# Library-Room-Booker

I'm a student in Tel Aviv University, stduying CS.

Booking a private room in the exact scienses library has become a nuisance - everything gets booked immediatly when it becomes available.

In order to assure that me and my friends are successfully booking a room, I've developed a library room booker using Selenium Python.

Combining this code with a Task Scheduler, I'm able to order a room automatically.
